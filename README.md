## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (with npm or Yarn)

## Getting Started

This repository is an example of how to generate PDFs from a PDF template.

In order to make the PSPDFKit for Web's library available for building, we have to copy the `pspdfkit-lib/` directory from `node_modules/pspdfkit/dist/` into the `assets` directory. This is done in the package.json `postinstall` script.

```bash
npm install # install dependencies

npm run postinstall
```

## Running the Example

We are ready to launch the app! ðŸŽ‰

1. Install the serve package:

```bash
npm install --global serve
```

2. Serve the contents of the current directory:

```bash
serve -l 8080 .
```

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to view the website.
